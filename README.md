# AirBNB Boston Data Set Analysis
This project is to analyse the AirBNB Boston dataset
Questions the analysis tries to answer:
#### What is the average availability by season? Does the price change by season?
#### Can we predict listing price? What are the main factors influencing a listing price?
#### Are super hosts less likely to get negative reviews than regular hosts?
